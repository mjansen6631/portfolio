            <h1>Bio</h1>
            <p> An avid explorer and lover of puzzles. After making a big life change and relocating from Southern California to Northern Colorado, decided to look for a new career. Finished a college degree years ago in Psychology but never ended up working in the field. When looking at tech careers I thought I would start in UI/UX, after looking at all available programs and speaking with a recruiter started my tech journey in coding/software development. Hoping to use this as a launchpad for a brand new career and used that change to allow myself to fund my upcoming wedding and hopefully purchase a home.</p>
